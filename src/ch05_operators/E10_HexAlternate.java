 * Exercise 10: (3) Write a program with two constant values, one with alternating binary
 * ones and zeroes, with a zero in the least-significant digit, and the second, also alternating,
 * with a one in the least-significant digit (hint: It’s easiest to use hexadecimal constants for
 * this). Take these two values and combine them in all possible ways using the bitwise
 * operators, and display the results using Integer.toBinaryString( ).
